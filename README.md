# Pingpongv4
Here's the initial code for a simple ping-pong operation with random actions.
This is just to test if the programming environment is successfully configured. I will not be uploading code for reinforcement learning in this project.

Now RL.py and human_data.py are currently useful.
Feel free to run human_data.py to build the data!

But please don't plagiarize it, because the model in this code has average performance and it's not my final code.
Please don't plagiarize, if you get caught, it's none of my business.
